This repository contains a mobile job search application built using Expo Go and TypeScript. It's a modern recreation of an older JavaScript tutorial, focusing on learning and implementing best practices with TypeScript.

Key features and goals:

* **Expo Go:** Leveraging Expo Go for rapid mobile development and testing.
* **TypeScript:** Transitioning from the original JavaScript tutorial to TypeScript for improved code maintainability and type safety.
* **Job Search Functionality:** Implementing core features for searching and displaying job listings.
* **Learning and Practice:** Primarily a learning project to explore Expo Go and TypeScript in the context of mobile app development.
* **Modernization:** Updating outdated practices and dependencies from the original tutorial.

This project serves as a practical exercise for understanding Expo Go and TypeScript in a mobile app development workflow. Contributions and feedback are welcome!



# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
